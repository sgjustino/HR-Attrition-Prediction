# Final Project for CSCA5622.

## Project Topic: Employee attrition can have significant financial and operational impacts on a company. Understanding the factors that contribute to employee attrition is essential for HR professionals and business leaders. In this analysis, we utilise various supervised machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, random forest and gradient boosting models to predict employee attrition. The dataset used in this analysis contains various features related to employee data and attrition as an outcome criterion. Through predictive models trained on the attrition dataset, I hope to understand the different approaches to machine learning better and to see how they can be translated in HR-related problems like employee attrition.

## This is a fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists to study attrition found in the link below: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/data
